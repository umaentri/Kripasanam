    Mary was present when, at her suggestion, Jesus worked his first miracle during a wedding at Cana by turning water into wine.[91] Subsequently, there are events when Mary is present along with James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas, called Jesus' brothers, and unnamed sisters.[92] According to Epiphanius, Origen and Eusebius, these "brothers" and "sisters" would be sons of Joseph from a previous marriage. This view is still the official position of the Eastern Orthodox churches. Following Jerome, those would be actually Jesus' cousins, children of Mary's sister. This remains the official Roman Catholic position. For Helvidius, would be full siblings of Jesus, born to Mary and Joseph after the firstborn Jesus. This has been the traditional Protestant position.
